1.Abstract:

In hyperparameter database, our objective is to analyze the effect of hyperparameters on the following algorithms: Distributed random forest, generalized linear model, gradient boosting machine, na√Øve Bayes classifier and so on.
The hyperparameter database also uses these data to build models that can predict hyperparameters without search and for visualizing and teach statistical concepts such as power and bias/variance tradeoff.

2. Data source:

Our data source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques, our training dataset has 81 columns, with 1460 records and our text dataset has 80 columns and with 1459 records.

3.Background:
 
The data we collected and stored concerns predicting housing transaction price which contains values of cities, floors, unit area households counts and parking capacity, rooms, heat fuel, heat type and front door structure. We separated and grouped data into different entities and attributes and build the one-to-many connections between them, which presented the data in more structured and organized way and allows us to query data, sort data, and manipulate data in various ways for the future performance.
